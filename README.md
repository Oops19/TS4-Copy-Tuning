# TS4-Copy-Tuning
A simple mod to copy tunings from one object to another.

It has no error checks so in case of an exception you will see an orange pop-up.

## Interactions
Within the debug menu (Shift-click on an object) there will be a new 'ðŸª„ Tuning' category.

It offers 'ðŸ—Ž Copy', 'ðŸ—Ž Paste' and 'â†¶ Restore'.
- Copy will save the tuning into a local, non-persistant, cache.
- Paste will copy the tunings within the object to have a backup. Then the tuning will be overridden.
- Restore will copy the tuning form the backup.
